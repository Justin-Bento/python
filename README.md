# Learning Python

In this folder contains my learning journey for learning python. 

## S.M.A.R.T Goals

### Specific

I'm going to learn the basic Python, to help me automate tasks and develop my programming knowledge. My long-term goal is to eventually build websites and host websites.

### Measurable, 

This goal will be achived by followiing tutorials and coruse on python, as well as attending classses and events around the topic.

### Achievable, 

It's achievable as I taught myself the basics again of javascript, so I believe I can learn one language more tailored to the code side of things and not have any obstacles with syntax and concepts.

### Relevant, 

The goal of learning python is to get recognition from people who don't know code, as hardly anyone outside of the tech world knows ruby and ruby on rails, as well as identify various viruses in the field of cyber security. On top of that, it will help me learn the basics of coding and eventually become my longer-term goal to build a website through Django.


### Time-Bound

My start date is 22--06-2022, and I would like to get the fundamentals down within four months which is 22-10-2022. Since the estimated time frame for learning python between two to six months.
