# Project - Learning Python

The learning Python folder is a folder that contains my learning journey with the Python language. Each file represents basic concepts that allow me to get comfortable with the language. My goal for this project is to become comfortable with Python, so I would have a faster learning curve when developing websites within the Django Project framework. My knowledge will come from freecodecamp, w3schools and learnpython.com and other online resources. So one can help me learn the syntax, and the other can help me know the theoretical side of things. You can find different things the more you scroll down. Thanks for listening to me, waffle. 

## Installation

Installing Python3 onto your system for macos, windows, and linux. I'm going to link you to tutorials however I will include some things that have helped me.

**Installing Python3 On Windows**

Suppose you have two drives in your system. Please, [ download and install python3 ](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on the C: drive. It will make things easy for you when using Powershell. If you're using the Windows Sub System For Linux like I am, you can check the version of python you're running; the package should be installed on Ubuntu. If it's not installed, download this package using this command.

```bash
# WSL and Debian or Ubuntu
$ sudo apt install Python3 -y
```

**Verifying Python3 Installation**

 Enter the command below to check if you have python3 installed. If you get an error message, that means you did not install python properly and you should try again. Here is a great youtube video that helped me work on it in seperate drives.

```bash
# Versions 3 and above
$ python3 --version
```

```bash
# Versions 2 and below
$ python --version
```
If you have an output like this. 

```bash
$ Python 3.10.5
```

CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLEDD PYTHON!


## Run Locally

**Downloading & Extracting The Files**

Always head to the Documents folder inside your system when working on development files. 

IT'S BAD PRACTICE TO USE YOUR ROOT DIRECTORY FOR ANY SYSTEM. 

To get to the Documents folder inside your Windows computer, you can open up the file Files app, head to Documents, right-click the space in files and click the Open in Terminal option inside the menu. Mine looks like I have my files separate from my boot drive; however, most computers would have C: option as the first letter. When you open up the terminal this file type should be similar;

Or you can open up the terminal app and run

Change Direcotry command for powershell. Please use backslash.

```PowerShell
$ cd .\Documents\
```
Change Direcotry command for Bash and Unix. Please use fowardslash.

```bash
$ cd ./Documents/
```

Then you can either clone the files using this command:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Justin-Bento/python.git
```

Or if you don't have git installed. 

Download the zip file for the project inside the dropdown menu after clicking the code button, and cut and past it into the folder of your choice.

**Installing Third Party Packages**

Python3 uses a package manager called PIP to install third party extentions. This is important since some files use these extentions to make the life of a developer a little bit easier. Some packages I use include [ package name ]. You can copy and paste the command below to install them.

```bash
```

Please note if your're using linux you have to have a seperate package installed to use PIP. Each linux distrobution would have a different name but here is what I know for the most popular distrobutions.

```bash
Arch:
```

```bash
Debian:
```

```bash
Fedora:
```

```bash
Solous:
```

If you know any other packages please make a new branch of the project and add it in and I'll check things out later.

**Running The Script**

To run a python3 script you need one command and it is

```bash
# For version 3 and above;
$ python3 ./file_name.py 
```

```bash
# For version 2 and above;
$ python ./file_name.py 
```

*please note the ./ is assuming you're already inside the Python folder. if you're not inside the folder in your terminal app run the command like this*

```bash
# For version 3 and above;
$ python3 ./python/file_name.py 
```

```bash
# For version 2 and above;
$ python ./python/file_name.py 
```

Lastly if you're using PowerShell please use backslash.

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  comming soon
```

## ðŸ“‹ S.M.A.R.T Goals

### Specific

I will learn basic Python to help me automate tasks and develop my programming knowledge. My long-term goal is to eventually build websites and host websites.

### Measurable, 

This goal will be achieved by following tutorials on Python and attending classes and events around the topic.

### Achievable, 

It's achievable as I taught myself the basics again of javascript, so I believe I can learn one language more tailored to the code side of things and not have any obstacles with syntax and concepts.

### Relevant, 

The goal of learning Python is to get recognition from people who don't know code, as hardly anyone outside of the tech world knows ruby and ruby on rails, as well as identify various viruses in the field of cyber security. On top of that, it will help me learn the basics of coding and eventually become my longer-term goal to build a website through Django.


### Time-Bound

My start date is 2022-06-22, and I would like to get the fundamentals down within four months which is 22-10-2022. Since the estimated time frame for learning Python is between two to six months.

## Resources Used For Learning Python.

Here is a list of resources I used when learning how to code in Python. Please let me know if there are any resources to share, and I can add them during my journey.

* LinkedIn Learning
* W3schools Python Syntax = [https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
* Common Interview Questions = https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/coding-challenges-interview-questions
* Automate the borinig stuff = https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
* Fullstack Pythoon = https://www.fullstackpython.com/


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm making full stack application... Using the pools tutorial that is found on django.

Once I finish the base code I will add additional features to the project to help me deepen my knowledge with Django and making a CRUD app.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback when it comes to code style guide or just , please reach out to using the issue pannel. For other business inquires please  email me at fake@fake.com
