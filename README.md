# Learning Python

This folder contains my learning journey in learning Python. 

## Setup Guide

Your first step is ensuring you have python installed on your system and check your current version. You can enter in the code below. It should look something like this.

````
userName@user-computer learn_python % python3 --version
Python 3.9.13
````

Your next step would be to download this project and place it in a memorable folder such as your desktop or inside your document folder.

Now your file is open I want you to search for your systems terminal app and open it. Once it is open, navigate to the learn python folder using

````
  for mac or linux machines
  cd ./learn_python. 
  cd ./Documents/learn_python.
  cd ./Desktop/learn_python.
  
  for windows machines
  cd .\learn_python. 
  cd .\Documents\learn_python.
  cd .\Desktop\learn_python.
````

Now, this step is optional. But I want you to list all the files inside the learn python folder using ``ls`` cmd to find and showcase all the python scripts inside the folder like below.

````
-rw-r--r--  1 username  staff  2465 Jul  8 10:38 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  3 username  staff    96 Jul  8 18:50 assets
-rw-r--r--  1 username  staff  1665 Jul  4 12:10 discount.py
-rw-r--r--  1 username  staff  1011 Jun 22 13:09 fizzbuzz.py
-rw-r--r--  1 username  staff   631 Jul  2 07:28 greetings.py
-rw-r--r--  1 username  staff  1702 Jul  5 11:59 rock-paper-scissors.py
-rw-r--r--  1 username  staff  1226 Jul  8 10:30 tip-calculator.py

````

Here you can type in ``code. .`` to see if you have visual studio code inside or use nano or vim to open the file.

Now here comes the fun part. It's time to run the script, using ``python3 file_name.py`` to run the program. 

( Hint: You can use the tab to auto-complete ;) )

````
userName@user-computer learn_python % python3 fizzbuzz.py

````

Finally, the last step is to exit the program; if anything unexpected happens. You can close the terminal by pressing ctrl+c or closing your terminal session.

To remove the folder, you have to jump out of the learn python folder using the ``$ cd ..`` command, then type ``$ rm -rf ./learn_python to`` remove the folder from your system. Or locate the file inside your system. Right-click and move to your trash.

If anything goes wrong, please let me know. 

## S.M.A.R.T Goals

### Specific

I will learn basic Python to help me automate tasks and develop my programming knowledge. My long-term goal is to eventually build websites and host websites.

### Measurable, 

This goal will be achieved by following tutorials on Python and attending classes and events around the topic.

### Achievable, 

It's achievable as I taught myself the basics again of javascript, so I believe I can learn one language more tailored to the code side of things and not have any obstacles with syntax and concepts.

### Relevant, 

The goal of learning Python is to get recognition from people who don't know code, as hardly anyone outside of the tech world knows ruby and ruby on rails, as well as identify various viruses in the field of cyber security. On top of that, it will help me learn the basics of coding and eventually become my longer-term goal to build a website through Django.


### Time-Bound

My start date is 22--06-2022, and I would like to get the fundamentals down within four months which is 22-10-2022. Since the estimated time frame for learning Python is between two to six months.
