# Project - Learning Python

This project is to help me learn the Python to eventually be able to create website with the Django Project. On top of that This folder contains my learning journey in learning Python from freecodecamp, and other online resources. This means my knowldege in python will be self-directed and 

## Installation

Installing Python3 onto your system for macos, windows, and linux. I'm going to link you to tutorials however I will include some things that have helped me.

**Installing Python3 On Windows**

If you have two seperate drives onto your system. Please install python3 on the C: drive as it will make everything else easier for you when using powershell. If you're using wsl2 like I am, python3 should be installed on ubuntu. However you can always check by opening your terminal, clicking the down arrow and selecgin 

**Installing Python3 On Macos**

You would want to install homebrew and replace the system python3 language for a more modern brew python3 script.


**Installing Python3 On Linux**

If you're running Fedora, Arch or Debian. Just run a system upgrade and update, reboot and install / update python3 package.

```
```


**Verifying Python3 Installation**

Just enter the command below to check if you have python3 installedl. 

```
python3 --version
```

If you have an older version

```
python --version
```

**Creating Your First Python3 File**

Creating your first python file is easy just type

```bash
$ cd Documents/
$ touch file_name.py
```
You can use the ls command to list all files inside the folder. Or you can use the find command to search for a specifc script to run.

```bash
$ ls -l # List files in a list 
$ $ find ./python/ -name file_name.py # find the file location
```
## Run Locally

**Downloading & Extracting The Files**


For all systems. Head to Documents in the files App right click and select the Open in Terminal option. Mine looks like as I have my files seperate from my boot drive however most computers would have C: option as the first letter.

```bash
D:\user\development
```

You don't want code files inside the root direcotry since you may have a chance of screwing things up. Assuming you have git installed onto your system, I want you to copy the URL and git clone and pase the URL  it inside the development folder. It should look something like this:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Justin-Bento/python.git
```

If you don't have git installed. Download the zip file for the project inside the dropdown menu after clicking the code button. What cloning the repository does it extracts files for you without you worrying about missing documents which making it easier to manage when handling  larger documents.

> *Please check if you have python installed.*

**Installing Third Party Packages**

Python3 uses a package manager called pip to install third party extentions. This is important since some files use these extentions to make the life of a developer a little bit easier. Some packages I use include [ package name ]. You can copy and paste the command below to install them.

```bash
```

Please note if your're using linux you have to have a seperate package installed to use PIP. Each linux distrobution would have a different name but here is what I know for the most popular distrobutions.

```bash
Arch:
```

```bash
Debian:
```

```bash
Fedora:
```

```bash
Solous:
```

If you know any other packages please make a new branch of the project and add it in and I'll check things out later.

**Running The Script**

To run a python3 script you need one command and it is;

```bash
   $ python3 ./file_name.py 
```
To run a python script below version3 you need one command and it is;

```bash
   $ python ./file_name.py 
```

*please not the file_name represents the atcual file your're trying to run*
## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  comming soon
```

## ðŸ“‹ S.M.A.R.T Goals

### Specific

I will learn basic Python to help me automate tasks and develop my programming knowledge. My long-term goal is to eventually build websites and host websites.

### Measurable, 

This goal will be achieved by following tutorials on Python and attending classes and events around the topic.

### Achievable, 

It's achievable as I taught myself the basics again of javascript, so I believe I can learn one language more tailored to the code side of things and not have any obstacles with syntax and concepts.

### Relevant, 

The goal of learning Python is to get recognition from people who don't know code, as hardly anyone outside of the tech world knows ruby and ruby on rails, as well as identify various viruses in the field of cyber security. On top of that, it will help me learn the basics of coding and eventually become my longer-term goal to build a website through Django.


### Time-Bound

My start date is 22--06-2022, and I would like to get the fundamentals down within four months which is 22-10-2022. Since the estimated time frame for learning Python is between two to six months.

## Resources Used For Learning Python.

Here is a list of resources I used when learning how to code in Python. Please let me know if there are any resources to share, and I can add them during my journey.

* LinkedIn Learning
* W3schools Python Syntax = [https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
* Common Interview Questions = https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/coding-challenges-interview-questions
* Automate the borinig stuff = https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
* Fullstack Pythoon = https://www.fullstackpython.com/


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm making full stack application... Using the pools tutorial that is found on django.

Once I finish the base code I will add additional features to the project to help me deepen my knowledge with Django and making a CRUD app.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback when it comes to code style guide or just , please reach out to using the issue pannel. For other business inquires please  email me at fake@fake.com
